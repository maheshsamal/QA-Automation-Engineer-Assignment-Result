  Scenario: Verify the address of a client.
    When I set JSON request body to:
    """
    {
      "Address1": "Park Street",
      "Address2":  "MG Road",
      "City": "Bangalore",
      "Country": "India",
      "Zip": 560002
    }
    """
    And  I send a POST request to "http://sample.com/Create an address/posts"
    Then the response status should be "201"
    And  the JSON response should have "address1" of type string and value "Park Street"
    And  the JSON response should have "address2" of type string and value "MG Road"
    And  the JSON response should have "City" of type string and value "Bangalore"
    And  the JSON response should have "Country" of type string and value "India
    And  the JSON response should have "Zip" of type numeric and value "560002"
